_Build a sort of "announcement's table" in perhaps the start of every floor, so that way people can see news
_Fill the floors with interactable computers that user can send emails from
_Add special codes in the elevator keypad that unlock things or floors... easter eggs
_Lots of interactable objects
_Add the possibility for users to leave sticky notes in some places, and they can choose the note's color
_Add npcs with dialogue, maybe a collection of dialogue that would randomly display each time the user clicks, and throughout the life of the project I myself would update that dialogue
_Need to think of a clever way for users to form connections and interact with each other, find each other without chat or chat groups
, maybe a cool way would be a board that showed all the users that were on a floor at a time, but I can think of something better
_Add ambient sounds to the offices, and special sound to special offices
_Maybe add some office people in the scenarios, static people, just for decoration, but this goes tied to user interaction, so if I find
a better way, I'll do that
_Add "ranks" for each user, like boss, intern, ceo, etc. roleplay
_Add user data that lets or not users access certain floors, based on the user's progress
_Think about what progress is..
_Make some unique items that only a user can have at a time, so that user can leave them in the environment so that other user can pick it up and repeat
_Implement a kind of market system where users would trade for unique objects with each other
_Make random npcs appear in the elevator, with custom dialogue and variety. Not all the time though
_Add accessibility because why not
_Make the UI where the user's name and rank are displayed appear like an ID card or something like that
_Add a usb object you can connect to a pc, to scan its files or to run an antivirus
_Add many activities around the office like the above, either just for fun or to earn money or progress ranks or something..
